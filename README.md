The goal was to use Neural Networks to predict future values from historical data in specific locations. 

In the context of the master thesis, 6 research papers were studied for the different types of neural network models on data related to air pollution and time series forecasting.

1. Paper 1
2. Paper 2
3. Paper 3
4. Paper 4
5. Paper 5
6. Paper 6

Furthermore, multiple different types of neural networks were developed in order to realize the final architecture of the proposed model. In addition, plentiful experimentation was conducted to determine the best hyperparameters for the model and was assessed both for its performance and accuracy but also for its generalization to more than one location around the globe.
